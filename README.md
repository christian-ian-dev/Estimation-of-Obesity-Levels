# Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition

## Overview
This project presents an end-to-end statistical analysis and machine learning workflow
to estimate obesity levels based on individuals’ eating habits, physical condition,
and lifestyle factors. The analysis uses a publicly available dataset from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository and focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA),
feature understanding, and predictive modeling.

The project was completed as part of a course final project and emphasizes
reproducibility, statistical validity, and clear communication of results.

## Dataset
**Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition**  
UCI Machine Learning Repository (2019)  
DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5H31Z  

The dataset includes demographic, dietary, and physical activity variables
(e.g., age, gender, eating frequency, physical activity level) along with a
categorical target variable representing obesity level.

### Target Variable
- Obesity Level (e.g., Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight, Obesity Types)

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess health-related survey data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and relationships
- Build and evaluate classification models to predict obesity level
- Assess model assumptions, performance, and limitations
